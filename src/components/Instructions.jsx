          eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You
          can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

          <span className="inst__bold">Cook the omelette: </span>Once the butter
          is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the
          eggs evenly coat the surface.

          <span className="inst__bold">Add fillings (optional): </span>When the
          eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
          middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="inst__bold">Fold and serve: </span>As the omelette
          continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
          fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="inst__bold">Enjoy: </span>Serve hot, with additional
          salt and pepper if needed.
